# Project management app

- Developed by Omar Trejo
- Developed for client (CM)

The client wanted to develop a quick, basic, proof-of-concept project management app. The code in this repository has been obfuscated to protect the client's identity. The code is unfinished (the client wanted to further work on this on his own), and is not completely clean (there are various parts, specifically in Angular, that could be removed without removing functionality). There are no tests and there various corner cases that have not been taken care of.

## Stack

- Django (backend)
- Angular 2 (frontend)
- Backend and frontend are separated
- Communicatino with Django REST API
